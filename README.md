## Description
Glauber_Dynamics.ipynb presents an animated simulation of spin dynamics in the Lenz-Ising model that uses a graph data structure-oriented implementation to enable
unique spin topologies such as a 3-neighbor honeycomb lattice. The simulation visualizes spin domains, magnetization, and total lattice energy vs. time using the
Glauber and Metropolis algorithms to run the simulation.

ising_graph.py provides a class that may be used to implement the Ising Model using graph data structures. It is provided in the repository for ease of importing.

**Collaborators**: Alex Hoang, Filippo Meoni, and Blake Steadham.
