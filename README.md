## Description
GlauberDynamics.ipynb presents an animated simulation of spin dynamics in the Lenz-Ising model that uses a graph data structure-oriented implementation to enable
unique spin topologies such as a 3-neighbor honeycomb lattice. The simulation visualizes spin domains, magnetization, and total lattice energy vs. time using the
Glauber and Metropolis algorithms to run the simulation.

This project was done in collaboration with Alex Huang, Phillip Meoni, and Blake Steadham.
